# jerseymaker

A port of https://www.ootputilities.com/jerseymaker/ to an Electron-based desktop app.

# Pre-requisites

Image processing (for uploaded logos etc.) *requires* a working installation of [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), version 7 is recommended as it's what I was developing against.

# macOS notes

Because I'm not a registered developer with Apple, macOS may block the app for security reasons (not a bad thing for it to do, ultimately).  If this happens, just CTRL-click on the app and choose "Open" from the menu - that will bring up a slightly different version of the security message with an option to open the app.  You *should* only have to do that once and macOS should store an exception for the app going forward.
